xmonad
======

The experience of using xmonad was interesting. I had never learned Haskell until I started using xmonad. I also hadn't used a tiling window manager before. It was cool how much control I had over my window manager; however, I have fallen in love with dwm and haven't looked back. I feel more productive using dwm and feel that overall the dwm project suits me better. Suum cuique!
